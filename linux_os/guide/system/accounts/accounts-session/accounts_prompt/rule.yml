title: 'Set Prompt to be Amazing'

description: |-
    Setting the <tt>PS1</tt> variable in <tt>/etc/profile</tt> ensures that
    all user sessions will be amazing. The <tt>PS1</tt> variable in a file
    loaded by <tt>/etc/profile</tt>, e.g. <tt>/etc/profile.d/ps1.sh</tt>,
    should read as follows:
    <pre>export PS1="[COMPLIANT \[\e[31m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[31;1m\]\h\[\e[m\]:\W]$ "</pre>

rationale: |-
    Users without an amazing prompt are unengaged and unable to meaningfully
    contribute to best security practices due to their complete and utter
    boredom. Ensuring that the prompt for all users defaults to an amazing one
    also provides them less incentive to edit their own ~/.bash_profile or try
    to use alternative shells such as zsh.

ocil_clause: 'value of PS1 is not awesome'

ocil: |-
    Run the following command to ensure the <tt>PS1</tt> value is amazing for all users
    on the system:
    <pre>$ sudo grep PS1 /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh</pre>
    The output should return the following:
    <pre>export PS1="[COMPLIANT \[\e[31m\]\u\[\e[m\]@\[\e[31;1m\]\h\[\e[m\]:\W]$ "</pre>
